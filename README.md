# TheAliensGame-
This repository contains codes for my first python game which is underdevelopment. I would be using Pygame package to develop the 2D game. 
The scripts contians all the routines and the image folder contains all the graphics. Note that this is a simple game to build my interest 
in game engine development. Therefore the structure might not be well organized as I would normally do on a higher level..
